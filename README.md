# Milestone Project (The Monkees)

Milestone project - User Centric Frontend Development

My intention is to provide a website of a band from the past and instil in the minds of its fans and 
potential fans, a brief story of there success, there iconic songs and videos, links to there social networks.
My mockup/wireframe i made for some ideas to the project i have done using "Pencil" which you can find [here](https://www.google.com)


## UX

Design is a black and white theme. This was to try and give it some authentic representation of there era in the 60's and 70's
Its designed to be easily read and navigated for both young and old.

Objectives:

 - Intro page, introduce the band members in text and pictures, also dates of up and coming events
 - Samples of some of there best songs
 - Music Videos to then provide them a reason to watch there videos online via you-tube. Objective: Have more views
 - Provide a form for people to have a access point to there details for contact in regards to an event
 - Links to band social media such us Facebook, Youtube, Twitter

 <!--Important to attach link to a wireframe-->

## FEATURES

The Project has 5 sections:

(1) Introduction to the band members, a choice to join a weekly/monthly newsletter and convert dates
(2) Cover album with a sample of what to expect per cover album
(3) A taster of a video with a brief explanation of the song
(4) A gallery of some iconic pictures of the band members individually and collectively
(5) A contact form if the general public would like to use there services
(6) Social link option for every page using a responsive navbar


### Features Left To Implement

An option to buy a cd/vinyl and merchandise

## Technologies Used

1 Html- its the foundation to writing code for all websites
2 Css- to implement different designs to elements from html code
3 [Bootstrap(3.3.7)](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/)
4 [Font Awsome](https://fontawesome.com/)
    - social link icons
5 [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)


## Testing

I checked my code on the html and css validator.
I tested the site on multiple devices. In that i checked that the grids and columns 
worked at different browser sizes. I checked that the social links worked on every page 
and in each responsive mode. I also checked that the video and music player worked. 
I checked the booking in forms were working, as in you can type in the boxes, also it automatically
memorises your details rather than having to re write if you wanted to go and book another 
event. When i press submit it goes back to the start of the page as there isnt anywhere to go, 
as the objective here is to have a clear and easy to navigate form. The end process as in processing 
the information as a purpose isnt needed as i havent practiced this yet in the course.

I found it difficult to understand/work out how to make the edges tidier in tablet mode
for my gallery. I had advice from the slack community but it didnt work as i wished in that
i wanted the edges looking neater. I also have a lack of understanding on how to have the video element
to increase in height in accordance with the image that was sitting next to it. 

Finally checked that on hover, the icon you hover changes color.

## Deployment
